"You know what the first rule of flying is?"
<br>
"...Love."
<br>
"You can learn all the math in the 'Verse, but you take a boat in the 
air that you don't love, she'll shake you off just as sure as a turn of 
the worlds. Love keeps her in the air when she oughta fall down, tells 
you she's hurtin' before she keels. Makes her a home."

"Storm's getting worse."

"We'll pass through it soon enough."
