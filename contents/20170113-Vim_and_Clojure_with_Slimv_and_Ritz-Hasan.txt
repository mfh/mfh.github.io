I need a development environment for programming in Clojure, so I set up my Vim
with Slimv which will communicate with Ritz server. Ritz is a swank server for
running clojure in Slimv. Below is the steps to setup the environment:

- Install Lein (it will also install standalone clojure).
- Add profiles.clj file into .lein dir and install Ritz, content of profiles.clj:
---
{:user {:plugins [
      [lein-ritz  "0.7.0"]
  ]}
---

- Add this to vim's config:
  let g:slimv_swank_clojure = '! tmux new-window -d -n REPL-RITZ "lein ritz 4005"'

- In project directory add a project.clj file with content, example for helloworld project:
---
(defproject helloworld "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "Helloworld Project"
  :url "http://example.com/helloworld"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]]
  :plugins [[lein-ritz "0.7.0"]]
  )
---

- Run Vim and type ,c to connect to Ritz server
